## 📋 Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub:** https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `great-sydney-quest` (or your preferred name)
3. **Visibility:** Choose Public or Private
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/great-sydney-quest.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

#### Example:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/himanshupal/great-sydney-quest.git
git push -u origin main
```

**If you get an authentication prompt:**
- Use a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) instead of password
- Or use [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/): `gh auth login`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### GPS Not Working on Vercel?

**Check these:**
1. ✅ App is on HTTPS (not HTTP)
2. ✅ Permission dialog appears in browser
3. ✅ Browser has location access enabled
4. ✅ Device GPS is turned on

**Test location in browser console:**
```javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
  pos => console.log(pos.coords.latitude, pos.coords.longitude),
  err => console.error(err)
);
```

### Build Fails on Vercel?

**Common fixes:**
1. Check build logs on Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies in `package.json`
3. Run `npm run build` locally first
4. Check TypeScript errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`

### Quests Not Showing?

**Verify:**
1. All quests are active (dates: Oct 27, 2025 - Dec 31, 2025)
2. GPS permission granted
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
