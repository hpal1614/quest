## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Step 1: Access the Quest**
```bash
# Server is running on port 3002
# Open browser:
http://localhost:3002

# You should see the new quest at the top:
# 🎯 "Test Quest - Postcard AR Adventure" (purple card)
```

### **Step 2: Start the Quest**
```bash
# Click on the purple quest card
# Click "START QUEST"
# You'll see the quest detail page
```

### **Step 3: Test AR Scanning**
```bash
# Click "📷 SCAN" button
# This opens the Enhanced AR Scanner
# Point camera at postcard.png (print or display on screen)
```

### **Step 4: AR Experience**
```
1. Camera opens with "Point camera at the postcard"
2. When postcard detected: 3D models appear!
   - 🏢 Burj Khalifa (rotating)
   - 🦅 Griffin (flying)
   - 🦘 Rooey (character animations)
3. After 2 seconds: Quest continues
4. Question overlay appears
5. Answer the question
6. Progress to next location
```

## 🎯 **AR Logic Explanation**

### **Smart QR Code Mapping:**
The system is designed so that **any postcard detection** maps to the **current expected location's QR code**:

```typescript
// For postcard AR quest, map all postcard codes to current expected location
if (quest.id === 'quest_test_postcard_ar') {
  const currentLocation = quest.locations.find(l => l.id === progress?.currentLocationId || 'start');
  if (currentLocation) {
    codeToValidate = currentLocation.qrCode; // Maps to POSTCARD-START, POSTCARD-ALPHA, etc.
  }
}
```

### **This Means:**
- ✅ **Same postcard.mind target** for all locations
- ✅ **Different questions** based on current progress
- ✅ **Sequential progression** maintained
- ✅ **GPS validation** still works
- ✅ **AR experience** consistent

## 📱 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Complete Quest Flow**
```
1. Start at your location (-33.8807, 151.2047)
2. Scan postcard → No question → Progress to Alpha
3. Move ~30m northeast to Alpha location
4. Scan postcard → "What is the capital city of Australia?" → "Canberra"
5. Move ~30m southwest to Beta location  
6. Scan postcard → "What is the largest state?" → "Western Australia"
7. Move ~20m southeast to Finish location
8. Scan postcard → "What is the tallest mountain?" → "Mount Kosciuszko"
9. Quest Complete! → Voucher Generated
```

### **Scenario 2: Wrong Sequence Testing**
```
1. Try to scan postcard at Alpha location first
2. Should show error: "Scan the Start QR code first to begin this quest"
3. Go to start location and scan
4. Then try to scan at Finish location (skip Beta)
5. Should show error: "Complete previous locations first"
```

### **Scenario 3: GPS Distance Testing**
```
1. Try scanning from >50m away
2. Should show error: "You're XXXm away. Move within 50m to scan"
3. Move closer and try again
```

### **Scenario 4: Hint System Testing**
```
1. At any checkpoint, enter wrong answer
2. Should show Hint 1
3. Enter wrong answer again
4. Should show Hint 2  
5. Enter wrong answer again
6. Should show Hint 3
7. Enter correct answer → Progress
```
